# "extern inline" in traditional gcc means that the function should be 
# inlined wherever it's seen, while in C99, "extern inline" means that i
# the function should only be inlined where the inline definition is 
# seen while in other places it's not inlined:
# http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2006-11/msg00006.html
#
# gmp checks "--std=gnu99" to use C99 convention however it internally 
# defines some "extern inline" functions in gmp.h, which is included
# by mainly .c files and finally lead a flood of redefinition function
# errors when linking objects together.
#
# So disable C99/ANSI detection to stick to tranditional gcc behavior
